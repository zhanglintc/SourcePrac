SourcePrac
==========

For my own C language practice.

Folder SourceFile contains the all source file.
We can only modify files here, and move them to
somewhere else and test it.


1.SourceMain.cpp:
	The entry point file.
	
2.affix.cpp:
	Contains some frequent use tool functions.

3.functions.cpp:
	Contains several functions.
	Each function may has no relationship.
	Each time I want to I want to test something,
	I add a new function to here.
	
4.others.cpp:
	Some obsoleted functions here.

4.header.h:
	All the declarations and destinations.

5.lex_1~3.cpp:
	iOS game woords' Plug-in function woords()'s lexicon library.
