SourcePrac
==========

For my own C language practice.

Folder SourceFile contains the all source file.
We can only modify files here, and move them to
somewhere else and test it.

#### ./src:

1. SourceMain.cpp:

    > The entry point file.
    
2. affix.cpp:

    > Contains some frequent use tool functions.

3. functions.cpp:

    > Contains several functions.
    > Each function may has no relationship.
    > Each time I want to I want to test something,
    > I add a new function to here.
    
4. others.cpp:

    > Some obsoleted functions here.

5. header.h:

    > All the declarations and destinations.


#### ./res:

1. lexicon_part_1~3.cpp:

    > iOS game woords' Plug-in function woords()'s lexicon library.<br>
    > Notice: unzip **lexicon.zip** before use. See `./res/README.md` to get help.
